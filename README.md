<h1 align="center">Multi-Robot Path Finding</h1>

<p>This project focuses on the development of a multi-robot path finding solution in industrial applications. The goal is to enable multiple robots to navigate in a shared environment while avoiding collisions with each other and obstacles. The project utilizes a combination of Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), Artificial Potential Fields (APF), and coverage path planning techniques</p>
